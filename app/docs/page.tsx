          <h2>What are Documents?</h2>

          <p>
            Documents in Brahmando are not just files — they are knowledge artifacts: structured
            intelligence units that define how agents reason, how workflows execute, and how MCP
            servers respond.
          </p>

          <p>
            Think of them as the reference layer of the universe — the ground truth that everything
            else builds on. Where general AI knowledge ends, a Document begins.
          </p>

          <h2>How Documents connect to the catalog</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Agents</strong> consume documents as context — policy references, domain
            knowledge, operating procedures, evaluation rubrics. Without documents, an agent
            operates on general knowledge. With them, it operates on <em>your</em> knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Workflows</strong> treat documents as inputs and outputs — contracts to review,
            reports to generate, briefs to process. The document is both the trigger and the
            artifact. A workflow without documents is a pipeline without purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>MCP servers</strong> expose document interfaces so that external systems can
            push or pull structured content in real time — bridging your data environment with the
            agent layer.
          </p>

          <h2>Getting started</h2>

          <p>
            If you are new to Brahmando, start with the{" "}
            <Link href="/csr">CSR programs hub</Link>. Documents become relevant once you are
            running agents or designing workflows under a customer agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            They are the knowledge layer, not the entry point. When you need an agent to understand
            your business context, operate within your policies, or produce consistent structured
            output — that is when documents matter.
          </p>

          <h2>Access</h2>

          <p>
            Document schemas, templates, and integration guides are provided to Brahmexa customers
            and approved community partners as part of the access program.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are ready to bring your own knowledge into the system, the access program is
            where that journey begins.
